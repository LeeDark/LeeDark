# About me 👋

Go backend engineer focused on web/microservices. I build gRPC/HTTP services,
care about latency and reliability, and keep systems observable (metrics/logs/traces).

Current: go-web-labs — labs and patterns for APIs, storage, and observability.


# Expertise

- Designing gRPC/HTTP services with clean contracts and backpressure
- Performance: pprof, flamegraphs, lock/contention analysis
- Observability: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana
- Storage: MySQL/Postgres, Redis patterns, MongoDB and ClickHouse basics
- Messaging/reliability: retries, idempotency, dead-letter queues
- Telecom: SS7/SIGTRAN, MNP/HLR, SMS routing


# Tech Skills

Go • gRPC/HTTP • Redis • MySQL • Postgres • MongoDB • Linux • Docker • Prometheus • OpenTelemetry • Grafana


# Interests or I'm currently learning ...

- Go, Backend, Web/REST
- SQL, SQLite, MySQL, Postgres
- Architectures I apply:
    - **Layered** for quick starts; **Clean/Hexagonal** when boundaries matter.
    - **Modular Monolith** with clear packages; migrate to services when needed.
    - **Observability-first**: metrics, tracing, structured logs, SLO-minded timeouts.
- Observability / Monitoring
    - **Observability**: ability to answer unknown questions from telemetry.
    - **Telemetry**: metrics, logs, traces; **Profiling** for CPU/mem/locks.
    - **Monitoring**: SLO-based alerts (latency p99, error rate), dashboards for dependencies.
    - **Practices**: correlation IDs in logs, end-to-end tracing, budgets/timeouts, structured logs.
- TDD/BDD, DDD/FDD/MDD/PDD.
- DevOps: Docker/Compose, Kubernetes/Helm, Grafana/Prometheus, Terraform/Ansible.


# Projects or I'm currently working on ...
